;;;; adapter-test.lisp --- Discord lane e2e against a fake Discord gateway.

;;;; SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
;;;;
;;;; Real nodecode gateway (WITH-TEMP-GATEWAY + provider stub) + a fake
;;;; Discord WS server (clack/wsd: sends HELLO, asserts IDENTIFY, dispatches
;;;; scripted MESSAGE_CREATEs) + the recording REST executor. Proves the
;;;; whole lane: typing before the answer, a room that holds the exchange, a
;;;; lane forked per ask, one answer message per ask, command-id dedupe of a
;;;; redelivered event, a button press acknowledged through the interaction
;;;; callback, and full thread unwind on stop. The digest flow
;;;; itself is the kit's (host-test.lisp); here Discord contributes its
;;;; platform — the plans, the mention, the where — and the gateway lap.
