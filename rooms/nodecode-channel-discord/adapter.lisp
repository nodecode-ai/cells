;;;; answer, the write-back — is the kit's (host.lisp, room.lisp). This file
;;;; is what Discord contributes: how a message, an edit, a delete and a
;;;; typing beat are spelled (rest.lisp, bound into a PLATFORM), how a
;;;; mention is written, where the room is, and the gateway websocket lap
;;;; that turns MESSAGE_CREATE into candidates.
;;;;
;;;; Thread topology (kit rule: no network I/O on a thread that is not ours):
;;;;   - Discord WS reader callback: parse + enqueue onto the inbound queue.
;;;;   - channel-discord-ws (supervised lap): drains the inbound queue, runs
;;;;     the pure reducer, sends gateway frames, admits messages through the
;;;;     host, owns the heartbeat.
;;;;   - the host's :FRAME fold and channel-discord-deliver pool: the kit's.

  "Discord's REST API v10 is open to you as the bot, from eval:
  (ncd:request METHOD PATH &key body headers timeout) => (:status N :body VALUE)
METHOD is \"GET\" \"POST\" \"PUT\" \"PATCH\" or \"DELETE\"; PATH is any v10 path, e.g. \"/channels/<channel>/messages?limit=20\" or \"/channels/<channel>/messages/<message>/reactions/%F0%9F%91%8D/@me\". A JSON body is a keyword plist, (:content \"hi\" :message_reference (:message_id \"…\")); objects come back the same way, arrays as vectors, null as :NULL. A file upload is an alist: ((\"payload_json\" . \"{…}\") (\"files[0]\" . #p\"/path\")). Anything the bot's permissions and intents allow — reactions, threads, pins, history, members, roles, DMs, webhooks — is one call. A write Discord accepts without answering a body comes back carrying :state too — the object the path names, read fresh afterwards, in this same (:status N :body VALUE) shape — so a reaction's :state holds the message and its reactions array. Report an outward effect from :state and never from :status: a 204 says Discord accepted the request for whatever id was in the path, and a message with no reactions has no reactions key at all. :read \"/other/path\" reads a different object, :read nil reads none. If anyone says the effect is not there, read it again and show what came back; do not restate the earlier claim, and do not offer their client as the explanation. The adapter posts your final answer where the ask is answered — a reply to it, or its thread: do not post it again yourself.
When you must ask before you can answer, and the answer is one of a few options, put the options on your question: (nck:answer-choices '(\"Option one\" \"Option two\") :platform \"discord\" :channel \"<channel>\" :thread \"<thread, or omit>\") — two to five labels of at most 80 characters — then end the turn with the question as your answer.
