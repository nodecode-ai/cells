;;;;
;;;; voice.lisp is the protocol with nothing moving in it and dave.lisp is
;;;; the library; this file is the part that runs. One VOICE-LANE holds a
;;;; voice channel the operator asked the bot to sit in, and owns four
;;;; threads and nothing else:
;;;;
;;;;   lap       the supervised voice websocket: identify, heartbeat, the
;;;;             DAVE handshake, speaking state. Never blocks on audio.
;;;;   listen    the UDP socket, read packet by packet: transport-open,
;;;;             DAVE-open, hand the frame to that speaker's utterance.
;;;;   work      one utterance at a time: transcribe it, then submit it as
;;;;             an ordinary ask through the kit. Seconds per item, which is
;;;;             exactly why it is not the listener.
;;;;   speak     the playback queue: WAV in, paced Opus out, interruptible.
;;;;
;;;; The rules the issue draws, kept here so they are checkable:
;;;;   - The bot sits in voice only where it is asked to: beside whoever
;;;;     types /voice join, or where voice_autojoin and voice_follow seat it.
;;;;     Nothing else joins, and nothing is heard outside a seat.
;;;;   - Only an allowlisted human's speech opens a turn. Our own audio, a
;;;;     bot's, a stranger's, silence and a malformed packet open nothing.
;;;;   - An utterance is ONE ask through NCK:HANDLE-CANDIDATE, the same door
;;;;     a typed line uses, in the room the text channel already owns. The
;;;;     text channel keeps the transcript, the status card and the answer;
;;;;     the voice channel is a second way in and a second way out, never a
;;;;     second conversation.
;;;;   - A new utterance stops whatever is being said. The room's own
;;;;     cancellation is unchanged: this only silences the speaker.
