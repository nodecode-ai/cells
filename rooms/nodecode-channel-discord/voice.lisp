;;;; The twin of gateway.lisp one layer down: the voice gateway's payloads,
;;;; the RTP packet, the transport cipher, the Ogg container an utterance is
;;;; handed to the transcriber in, and the rule that says when someone has
;;;; stopped talking. No I/O, no threads, no libdave — voicelap.lisp owns the
;;;; socket, the session and the workers, and dave.lisp owns the library.
;;;;
;;;; What was measured against live Discord on 2026-09-18, because each of
;;;; these cost a run to find:
;;;;
;;;;   - The voice endpoint's PORT is load-bearing. VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE
;;;;     answers c-sea01-9b97985a.discord.media:8443 and the port varies by
;;;;     server (443, 2087, 8443 seen). Dialing the host on 443 regardless —
;;;;     which is what every older client did — is answered with close 4006,
;;;;     "Session is no longer valid", which reads like a stale session and
;;;;     is not one.
;;;;   - max_dave_protocol_version 0 is closed with 4017. There is no
;;;;     presence-only mode left to fall back to.
;;;;   - Binary frames are [seq uint16 BE][opcode uint8][payload] coming in
;;;;     and [opcode uint8][payload] going out.
;;;;   - Discord forms no MLS group while the bot is alone in the channel.
;;;;     No second member, no proposals, no ratchet, and so no media in
;;;;     either direction. That is normal and not a fault.
;;;;   - Under an -rtpsize mode the unencrypted head is 12 octets plus four
;;;;     per CSRC plus four more for the extension preamble when the
;;;;     extension bit is set; that head is the AAD. The 32-bit nonce is the
;;;;     packet's last four octets and the GCM IV is those four big-endian
;;;;     followed by eight zeros. The extension BODY is inside the
;;;;     ciphertext, so it is skipped after decryption, not before.
