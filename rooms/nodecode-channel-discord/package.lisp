;;;; The Discord channel adapter: a pure gateway-websocket protocol reducer
;;;; (gateway.lisp), REST request plans (rest.lisp), and the platform plus
;;;; the gateway lap the kit's host runs over (adapter.lisp). The room/lane
;;;; topology, the gate and the digest delivery are the kit's; the kit's
;;;; thread-topology rule (no network I/O in wsd callbacks) binds every
;;;; callback in this package.
