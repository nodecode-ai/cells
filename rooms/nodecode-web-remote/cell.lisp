;;;;
;;;; The shipped web cell serves the page at loopback only, and that is right:
;;;; the gateway refuses every request whose Host is not loopback, which is what
;;;; stops a rebound name from reaching it. This cell is the one front door for
;;;; the rest of the tailnet, and it adds nothing to the tailnet except an https
;;;; listener: `tailscale serve' terminates TLS on this node's own MagicDNS name
;;;; with a certificate Tailscale obtains and keeps, stamps who connected, and
;;;; proxies to a loopback port this file listens on (remote.lisp).
;;;;
;;;; It serves on an https port of its own -- 8443 unless the setting says
;;;; otherwise -- never on 443, which belongs to whatever else this node serves.
;;;; A path under 443 was measured and rejected: `tailscale serve --set-path'
;;;; strips the prefix before the request arrives, and the page asks its gateway
;;;; for absolute paths (/api/...), which would leave the prefix behind.
