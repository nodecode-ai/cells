;;;;
;;;; One turn = one channel answer. Chat channels are message surfaces, not
;;;; terminal transcripts: per-round passthrough drips narration fragments
;;;; into the channel while tool-only rounds read as dead air (the
;;;; 2026-08-19 discord audit's 95-round turn posted 16 fragments across 12
;;;; minutes of silence). The digest folds a turn's stream facts into ONE
;;;; live status line — posted when the turn first calls a tool, then edited
;;;; in place on the delivery worker's tick — and holds the newest non-empty
;;;; assistant text as the turn's final answer, delivered once on
;;;; turn.completed.
;;;;
;;;; The status line is a CARD (DIGEST-CARD): what the turn is doing now, in
;;;; the words the TUI's cards read — `Running just lint' — the thought that
;;;; chose it, the newest of its steps as a checklist, the pictures it looked
;;;; at, and its numbers. The card is data, and each platform draws it:
;;;; Discord a container of components whose accent is the phase, each step a
;;;; row whose Output button shows what it answered, Telegram HTML whose dot
;;;; is the phase, its steps in a quote (CARD-HTML). Every step of the turn
;;;; stays on the digest, and the card's Details control answers whoever
;;;; pressed it, privately, with all of them (DIGEST-DETAILS). The
;;;; operator's pick, 2026-10-03, of four drawn variants (artifact
;;;; W5ZctEPucc6WjHKajmjr4m), over a line of five equal facts and a room-wide
;;;; tool trail; drawn as components since, its steps pressable.
;;;;
;;;; The card is the turn's RECORD once it has one: a completed turn posts its
;;;; answer below it and the card settles to `Done in 27s' over its last
;;;; steps, so the room keeps what the work was beside what it said. A turn
;;;; that never earns a card — quick, no tools, no long thinking — is covered
;;;; by the typing indicator and posts nothing but the answer. A failed or
;;;; stopped turn settles its card to the notice, its detail included.
;;;;
;;;; A lane can also be admitted late, behind a concurrency gate. That is a
;;;; :QUEUED phase, and it earns a line at once: waiting invisibly behind an
;;;; unbounded typing indicator is the failure this replaces.
;;;;
;;;; Input parked BEHIND a running turn — a steer that ends it at its next
;;;; round boundary, a follow-up that waits for it — is the other wait, and
;;;; it rides the running turn's own line as ⌎ rows, the TUI's pending band
;;;; in channel form: the line the operator is already watching says what
;;;; is waiting and when it runs, and stays the newest message in the chat,
;;;; so the wait is visible from the chat list and from wherever they scroll
;;;; back to. A pin was considered for this and rejected (nc-private#3): a
;;;; pin leaves a permanent service row per ask, is invisible from the chat
;;;; list, and exists on two platforms. The rows come whole from every
;;;; kernel queue snapshot, so a promotion or a retraction clears its row.
;;;;
;;;; The status line posts as a silent reply to the ask it stands in for:
;;;; in a room running several lanes at once, the anchor is what says which
;;;; ask a line belongs to, and the answer that replaces it replies to the
;;;; same message.
;;;;
;;;; Reasoning folds in the same way, from the live reasoning deltas and
;;;; from each round's committed reasoning_content: a round that puts
;;;; everything in its thinking and answers with JSON null (the audit's
;;;; qwen-class rounds) is not a silent round, and the card says so with the
;;;; thought's headline (THOUGHT-HEADLINE) — its newest bold title, else its
;;;; newest whole sentence, never a tail cut mid-word. Thinking is display
;;;; only — a live trace with no retention past the card and its details —
;;;; and never becomes the channel's answer.
;;;;
;;;; Fold functions mutate the digest and perform NO I/O: adapters call them
;;;; under the lane lock on the sync reader thread (the telegram delta
;;;; accumulator precedent — classify + fold only, never a REST call).
;;;; DIGEST-STATUS-PLAN is the pure decision seam the delivery worker
;;;; drives; the worker performs at most one platform call per plan and
;;;; records the outcome back through DIGEST-STATUS-ATTEMPTED /
;;;; DIGEST-STATUS-DELIVERED.
