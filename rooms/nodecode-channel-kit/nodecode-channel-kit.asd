;;;; Optional quicklisp/ASDF cell, NOT part of the organism core: nothing in
;;;; src/src names this system. The folder loader (kernel cells.lisp) loads
;;;; it at boot when its directory sits under ~/.nodecode/cells/; the
;;;; gateway calls this system's START-CELL after recovery — the channel host
;;;; that reads channels.<id> sections and starts each enabled adapter system.
;;;;
;;;; The .asd sits INSIDE its folder (ADR-0229): a cell is a directory
;;;; carrying its .asd, and it is installed by putting — or symlinking — that
;;;; directory under ~/.nodecode/cells/. Presence is enabled; nothing in
;;;; config names it. The `just *` recipes register each cell
;;;; directory with ASDF the same way.
;;;;
;;;; bordeaux-threads is declared explicitly: the core system only receives it
;;;; transitively, and this system's delivery and supervision threads depend
;;;; on the bt2 API directly. websocket-driver and cl+ssl likewise:
;;;; SEVER-WS-TRANSPORT reaches the raw fd beneath a platform TLS websocket.
;;;;
;;;; The gateway itself is reached in-process — NLE:HOOK :FRAME for egress,
;;;; NLE:SUBMIT for ingress, the NLK session API — never over loopback.
