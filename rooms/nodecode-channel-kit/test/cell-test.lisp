;;;; Proves the core seam's one convention end to end with in-memory fake
;;;; systems registered as loaded cell records: the gateway calls
;;;; <PACKAGE>::START-CELL (config) after recovery — the whole parsed
;;;; config and nothing else, a cell reaches the organism in-process; the
;;;; returned stop thunk runs first in STOP-GATEWAY's unwind. A failing
;;;; cell is one warning, never a boot failure. The kit's own START-CELL
