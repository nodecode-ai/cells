;;;; Port of the Zig-era channel kit's outbound.ts: one text chunker, one
;;;; HTTP request-plan shape, one retry/429/backoff execution loop, one
;;;; plan-recording fake executor. Adapters contribute request builders;
;;;; nothing protocol-specific lives here.

;;;; Executors are the ONLY seam that performs platform I/O, and they run
;;;; exclusively on delivery-worker / poll threads — never inside a wsd
