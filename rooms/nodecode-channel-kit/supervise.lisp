;;;; grown a lap contract: a channel transport loop (Discord WS connection,
;;;; Telegram long poll) runs as repeated laps under one supervisor thread.
;;;; Transient transport failure is absorbed here with exponential backoff;
;;;; permanent failure (:fatal — e.g. a rejected bot token) stops the lane
;;;; with one loud warning and never retries.

  ;; laps: every blocking wait must be bounded (queue timeouts, HTTP read
  ;; timeouts, transport severs) so STOP-P is consulted on a real cadence; an
  ;; abandoned lap exits on its own when its current wait completes, holding
