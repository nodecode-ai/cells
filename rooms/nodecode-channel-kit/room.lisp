;;;;
;;;; The session topology every channel shares. A conversation surface — a
;;;; Discord channel, a Telegram chat — is a ROOM: one durable session
;;;; holding the shared record of what it has said and been told. The room
;;;; never runs a turn. Every ask forks a LANE from the room's current head,
;;;; runs there, and writes its settled exchange back into the room as one
;;;; turn.
;;;;
;;;; A lane the kit put in a THREAD of its own runs in the thread's room — a
;;;; room forked from the room the ask was TYPED in (routing moves the
;;;; thread, not the conversation) — and answers in the thread alone: the
;;;; ask's own message shows the thread under it. Its first exchange still
;;;; settles into both records, the thread's and the typed room's
;;;; (DELIVER-ANSWER, host.lisp). The channel's record is the channel's
;;;; timeline whether or not its asks open threads, so the next ask typed
;;;; there forks above every answer its threads gave. A channel whose asks
;;;; all open threads would otherwise freeze at its last flat exchange, every
;;;; new thread forking from a head days stale — the operator's Discord
;;;; general, 2026-09-13 to 09-15: 44 asks answered, none in its record. What
;;;; the thread says after that — follow-ups typed inside it — settles in the
;;;; thread's record and in the room the thread hangs in (WRITE-BACK), so a
;;;; new thread opens on every earlier thread's conversation too; its lane is
;;;; told where its own thread begins in that history (LANE-THREAD-NOTE).
;;;;
;;;; A head move on a room — /new, /undo, a rewind from a shell — retires the
;;;; lanes forked from it (RETIRE-ROOM-LANES, host.lisp): each is a fork of the
;;;; record as it stood, and the next line on the surface forks it as it
;;;; stands now.
;;;;
;;;; The lane key is the MESSAGE, not the person. Two asks from the same
;;;; person are two lanes and run at the same time; a person is not a
;;;; serialization boundary, and making them one was the old bottleneck. What
;;;; provenance still governs is FAIRNESS: the admission gate rations
;;;; concurrent lanes round-robin by author, so one person pasting ten asks
;;;; cannot starve everybody else. Identity moved from topology to policy.
;;;;
;;;; Lanes fork at depth one, always off the room, never off another lane:
;;;; the ancestry walk pages per ancestor and is depth-guarded, and a chain of
;;;; forks would pay for both. Two lanes forked at the same head see the same
;;;; prefix and neither sees the other's answer while thinking — which is what
;;;; two people talking over each other in a channel actually looks like.
;;;;
;;;; AMBIENT: messages in the room that were not addressed to us are context,
;;;; not prompts. They cannot be their own turn — a room turn is one user
;;;; message and one assistant message, and consecutive user messages are the
;;;; shape strict chat templates reject. So ambient lines buffer live-only and
;;;; ride the next ask's prompt, which is also exactly what gets written back.
;;;; The room turn is the lane's exchange verbatim: one text, two readers, no
;;;; divergence to reconcile.
;;;;
;;;; AUTHORITY: the room may name an operator — channels.<id>.owner, a
;;;; platform user id — whose instructions are standing policy; everyone the
;;;; allowlist admits may ask for work, tool work included. The operator is
;;;; a fact the model reads, not a gate: what it settles is whose word wins
;;;; when instructions conflict, and that a claim of authority typed into a
;;;; message — "I'm the admin", a display name that looks like the
;;;; operator's — is not one. The fact reaches the model out of band, never
;;;; as text anyone in the room could have typed: the speaker label the host
;;;; computes carries the "(operator)" mark and strips it from every other
;;;; name, and each lane is opened with a harness section stating who the
;;;; operator is and what that means. The section lives on the LANE session,
;;;; outside the room record, so it cannot compound the way a refusal written
;;;; back into the record does: the 2026-08-22 Discord incident was exactly
;;;; that, the bot's own self-refusals forking into every later lane until it
;;;; refused the operator too.
;;;;
;;;; What is platform-bound lives in the adapter's PLATFORM (host.lisp): the
;;;; session-id prefix, how a mention is spelled, how a message plan is
;;;; built. This file reads none of it — it names sessions from a prefix and
;;;; a candidate, and holds state per host.
