;;;; One live-only status plist per adapter, written by adapter threads and
;;;; read by the /channels slash command (nle:register-command). A change of
;;;; STATE is the adapter
;;;; speaking: the new status line goes out as a standing notice under the
;;;; section's key (NLE:NOTICE), so every attached shell sees "discord:
;;;; running, connected" the moment READY lands and "discord: stopped —
;;;; discord_gateway_fatal_close_4004" the moment it dies, instead of in a
;;;; log — and the model reads the same line in its cells section.
;;;; Retention: live-only — nothing here is durable or replayed.
