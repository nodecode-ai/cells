;;; Telegram's parser is GitHub's Markdown with HTML, and some of its habits

;;; 2026-10-04): a lone line break joins the lines it parts; a tag it does not
;;; know vanishes without a word (`Vec<String>' read `Vec') and one it knows
;;; opens (an unclosed <details> folded the rest of the message away); a
;;; picture by a link that holds none refuses the whole message
;;; (RICH_MESSAGE_PHOTO_NO_MEDIA_FOUND); a word after a line's leading # is a
;;; heading; a table needs a blank line over it. Outside code, then,
;;; RICH-MARKDOWN spells < as an entity, escapes the ! of ![ and a leading #
;;; that opens no heading, keeps every line break (two spaces before it) and
;;; opens a table with a blank line. Code passes as written: Telegram draws
;;; it literally, entities and all. An & stays as it is: a link's address
;;; decodes no entity, so &amp; would break it.
