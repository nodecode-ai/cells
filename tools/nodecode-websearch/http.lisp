;;;; Every byte this cell moves goes through HTTP, so a test stubs that one
;;;; name (the notify cell's LAUNCH pattern) and never touches the network.
;;;; The seam answers values, never signals, for an HTTP status: a 4xx/5xx is
;;;; a fact the caller formats, and only transport failure — DNS, TLS, a
;;;; timeout — propagates as an ERROR for WITH-REDACTED-ERRORS to redact.
;;;;
;;;; The fetch path streams: a page is read in 64 KiB chunks under a byte cap
;;;; and a wall clock, because dexador's READ-TIMEOUT is per read and a slow
;;;; drip could otherwise hold the turn worker for minutes. The pool is never
;;;; used: an aborted read on a pooled socket would poison the provider lanes'
;;;; connections (the provider.lisp listing GET takes the same posture).
