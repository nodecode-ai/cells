;;;; team@N (arXiv 2609.21032): N identical sessions work one task from one
;;;; directory, and the directory is the whole protocol. Nothing here relays a
;;;; message, assigns a role or runs a controller: a node claims its slot by
;;;; an atomic mkdir, publishes through LOG, and scores through ./verify, the
;;;; one writer of SCORES. The nodes are ORDINARY sessions -- every tool,
;;;; their own transcript, a row on /sessions under the session that opened them.
;;;;
;;;; What the cell owns is six things. The layout (TEAM:OPEN). The seat:
;;;; /team TEXT puts TEXT to the session's standing team, seated through the
;;;; same open at the first /team and the same nodes after it, a spent
;;;; node's seat taken by a fresh one at the next -- a team with no scorer,
;;;; whose product is LOG, best/ and work-K/. Nothing else the operator types
;;;; reaches it: the first real runs seated every input, a status question
;;;; included, and the nodes billed three and a half times what their
;;;; session did. The one paragraph every node reads, byte-identical
;;;; (*PROMPT*, or *UNSCORED* for a team with no scorer). What a node has
;;;; LEFT: advice on NLE:TURN-BUDGET answering the configured budget minus
;;;; the session's summed turn.usage minus the time since the team opened --
;;;; a standing team's clock re-based at each /team -- so a node prompted
;;;; again never starts a fresh token budget: the kernel enforces it,
;;;; refusing tool calls past it. What a node keeps: nothing past the image --
;;;; advice on NLK:RECORD-DEFINITIONS keeps its definitions out of the
;;;; operator's layer. And the parent's side: TEAM:WATCH blocks until SOLVED,
;;;; every node settled, or the deadline, then answers the best -- the
;;;; SCORES maximum, confirmed by one more run of the same ./verify the nodes
;;;; ran. A form that blocks is backgrounded by the eval substrate and its
;;;; exit wakes the session, so the watch is a plain loop and the parent is
;;;; never the one waiting.

(defparameter +primer+
  "A team is available through the nodecode-team cell: Lisp functions in the team: package,
called through eval. Every one returns a string; every refusal is ERROR: TEAM-ERROR with the
reason. A team is identical full-tool sessions working one task in parallel from one shared
directory; they never message each other or you, the directory's files are the only channel,
and each runs under a fixed budget of tokens and time.
The operator seats a session's standing team from their shell with /team TEXT: team.nodes nodes
under the session, working from team/<session>/standing/ in the home, each given TEXT behind its
own marker. Every later /team TEXT goes to the same nodes, a steer of the turn a node is running;
nothing else the operator types reaches them, and between inputs they sit idle. /team alone
reads where the team stands and /team stop stops it. A standing team's seconds count from the
latest /team, and a node's tokens are its cap over every input it takes: a node that has spent
them is never prompted again, and at the next /team a fresh node takes its seat. A standing team
has no scorer: its product is LOG, best/ and work-K/ in that directory, and nothing of it comes
back into the session by itself; (team:best DIR) reads it. A relative DIR is the calling
session's own directory's.
  (team:open \"task\" &key score dir)   make a directory and start team.nodes nodes (1 to 5) on
      TASK, answer the directory; call it again for more. SCORE is an executable, copied in as
      ./score: `./score CANDIDATE' prints one number on its last line (higher is better) and
      exits 0 only when the task is met, and the nodes score through `./verify K CANDIDATE',
      which runs it and records SCORES. Without SCORE the team is unscored, like the standing
      one: no ./score, ./verify or SCORES, and its best answers none.
  (team:watch \"dir\")   block until SOLVED exists, every node has settled or the deadline
      passes, then answer the best: the SCORES maximum, confirmed by one more ./verify run.
      It outlives the call's window: it keeps running in the background and its exit starts
      your next turn. Never poll for it: end your turn.
  (team:best \"dir\")   the same answer now, without waiting.
  (team:stop \"dir\")   stop every node; the directory stays.
The nodes are sessions team-<team>-node-<k>: TEAM is the identifier of the session they hang
under, whose standing team and every team it opens count K up together, and each node's input
opens with that same [team-<team>-node-<k>] marker. /sessions draws the nodes under their
session, and (recall-log :session-id ...) reads one. A node cannot open or
seat a team, and nothing a node defines is kept in the organism's layer."

message a peer: everything you share goes through the files here, and LOG is the channel. ~
Before anything else read TASK.md, LOG, SCORES, DISCONFIRMED, ADOPTED and every ~
slots/*/approach. Then claim a slot: run `for i in $(seq 0 ~d); do mkdir slots/slot-$i ~
2>/dev/null && echo $i && break; done` -- the mkdir that succeeds is yours, K; if none ~
succeeds the team is full, so say so and stop. Write slots/slot-K/approach: your approach in ~
one paragraph and what you deliberately will not assume, DISTINCT from every approach already ~
claimed -- if a lower slot took yours, change yours. Work only inside work-K/; peers may read ~
it, and you never write in another slot's. The Lisp image is shared like the directory: name ~
anything you define sK-... so you never redefine a peer's function or the organism's; nothing ~
you define is kept past this image. Score ~
every real attempt with `./verify K <candidate>`: it prints the score and records it in ~
SCORES itself, so never write SCORES by hand. Append one line to LOG with `./log K KIND \"TEXT\"`, which writes `[node K <UTC time>] KIND: ~
TEXT` in one atomic write, a newline always -- only for measured progress, giving the score, ~
the exact command that reproduces it, and the lineage (whose idea it builds on); label a weak ~
claim weak. Spend part of your effort trying to falsify the leading idea, yours included, and ~
send what failed and the command that showed it through `./log K fail \"TEXT\"`. Re-read LOG and SCORES every few attempts. Adopt a ~
peer's approach only when SCORES shows it clearly beating yours on a result you reproduced, or ~
yours is blocked; record the adoption in ADOPTED with why, and keep one meaningful variation ~
of your own (a parameter, a subcase, a representation, a fallback). best/ is the team's one ~
graded artifact: replace it only while holding `flock best.lock`, only after re-checking its ~
current score under the lock, and only with a strictly better verified candidate. Every turn ~
takes a real action and reads its result; bookkeeping is never a substitute for one. When ~
`./verify` exits 0 the task is met: promote the candidate to best/, write SOLVED (your slot, ~
the score, the reproducing command) and stop. If SOLVED already exists, reproduce it once with ~
./verify, append the result to LOG, and stop. Otherwise keep improving until your budget is ~
