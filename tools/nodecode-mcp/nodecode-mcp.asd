;;;; nodecode-mcp.asd --- MCP servers as Lisp functions.

;;;;
;;;; Optional cell, NOT part of the organism core: nothing in src/src names
;;;; this system. The folder loader (kernel cells.lisp) loads it at boot when
;;;; its directory sits under ~/.nodecode/cells/; the gateway calls
;;;; START-CELL after recovery, which connects every server named under
;;;; mcp.servers in ~/.nodecode/config.jsonc — the same contract the retired
;;;; Zig client read — and registers the /mcp slash command.
;;;;
;;;; Mono-tool: no provider tool is registered. Every remote tool becomes a
;;;; Lisp function in the MCP package, (mcp:files/read-file :path "x"),
;;;; generated from the server's tools/list with a real &key lambda list and
;;;; the description as its docstring, over one chokepoint (mcp:call ...).
;;;; A <harness key="mcp"> block carrying the live catalog teaches the model
;;;; the vocabulary in every session; it is injected live, never stored, so
;;;; removing the folder leaves nothing behind.
;;;;
;;;; Two transports, as the Zig client had: stdio (a child process, newline
;;;; delimited JSON-RPC) and streamable HTTP (one POST per message, JSON or
;;;; SSE reply). No reader thread: every read happens on the calling thread
;;;; under that call's own deadline, which is also the whole cancellation
;;;; story — an eval thread is never interrupted by Esc, only by its deadline
;;;; or (eval-interrupt).
;;;;
;;;; Every dependency named below is already in the serving image (a
;;;; transitive dependency of nodecode): LOAD-CELLS freezes the loaded
;;;; systems immutable and then loads this one at boot.
;;;;
;;;; The .asd sits INSIDE its folder (ADR-0229); presence is enabled. The
;;;; `just mcp-*` recipes register this directory with ASDF the same way.
