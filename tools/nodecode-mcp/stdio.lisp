;;;; The stdio transport: one frame per line on the child's stdin and
;;;; stdout. The child's stderr goes to an append-only file under
;;;; *LOG-DIRECTORY* — never to this image's fd 2 (severed to a log while a
;;;; TUI owns the terminal) and never to /dev/null (the first question about
;;;; a server that dies at startup is "what did it print").
;;;;
;;;; Reads are bounded without a reader thread: READ-CHAR-NO-HANG drains
;;;; what the stream holds, and when it holds nothing the thread parks in
;;;; SB-SYS:WAIT-UNTIL-FD-USABLE for what remains of the deadline. A plain
;;;; READ-LINE after the wait would still block on a half-written line; the
;;;; partial line a deadline interrupts is kept on the transport and resumed
;;;; by the next read, so a late reply never turns into garbage.
;;;;
;;;; The single spawn goes through LAUNCH, the one name a test stubs.
