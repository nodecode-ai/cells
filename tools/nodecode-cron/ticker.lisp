;;;; ticker.lisp --- one sleeping thread, the fire, and the outcome it reads back.
;;;;
;;;; SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
;;;;
;;;; The ticker sleeps until the nearest due instant and is poked by every
;;;; mutation (the eval-guard shape in engine/exec.lisp: a semaphore waited
;;;; on with a timeout). It never polls a fixed cadence.
;;;;
;;;; A fire is one NLE:SUBMIT into the job's session with a command id
;;;; naming the due instant, `cron:<id>:<unix>': the kernel's durable
;;;; admission makes a second submit of the same id a :DUPLICATE that
;;;; spawns nothing, so at-most-once needs no claim record of its own. The
;;;; schedule is advanced BEFORE the submit (hermes' rule): a crash between
;;;; the two loses a fire, never doubles one. A job whose previous fire is
;;;; still running is skipped for this due instant and told so, not queued
;;;; behind itself. A due instant seen later than half its period (clamped
;;;; to two minutes and two hours) is a miss: recorded, said, and the
;;;; schedule fast-forwarded past now, so an outage never burst-fires.
;;;;
;;;; The outcome is read off the :FRAME point. The hook runs on the turn
;;;; worker that publishes, so it folds and pokes ONLY -- the newest
;;;; assistant text and the terminal kind land on the in-flight record
;;;; under the lock, and the ticker thread settles it: the job's LAST, the
;;;; standing notice under `cron:<id>' (the board reaches every attached
;;;; shell and every session's live tail), the row. An answer that is
;;;; exactly SILENT settles quietly. A fire runs under its job's timeout as
;;;; the turn's budget (BUDGET-HOOK on NLE:TURN-BUDGET): past it the fire's
;;;; tool calls are refused and its answer is what it has, so a slow fire
;;;; still reports and the ticker never cancels one.
;;;;
;;;; An answer is also RETURNED to the session that scheduled the job (the
;;;; job's ORIGIN) as that session's next request: one user message -- the
;;;; fire line, a colon, the whole answer -- through the same
;;;; NLE:SUBMIT every operator prompt takes, which starts a turn there when
;;;; the session is idle and queues behind the turn it is running otherwise
;;;; (the eval-wake shape: *SESSION-WAKE*). So the operator sees the cron's
;;;; result arrive as a request and the model there answers it in a turn of
;;;; its own. Two earlier shapes were tried and read wrong (s-XKML3AQM,
;;;; 2026-09-06): a settled exchange recorded while idle landed as a detached
;;;; pair beneath the model's own summary, and a steer folded the text into a
;;;; running turn without a turn of its own. Until the ingress takes the
;;;; message the report waits on the job's row (durably, across a restart).
;;;;
;;;; THREAD RULE: SUBMIT-PROMPT is the one seam that reaches the organism's
;;;; ingress -- a fire into the job's session and a report into its origin
;;;; both go through it -- called on the ticker thread or a verb's caller
;;;; thread, never on the publishing thread; a test stubs it.
