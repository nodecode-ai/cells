;;;; Optional quicklisp/ASDF cell, NOT part of the organism core: nothing in
;;;; src/src names this system. The folder loader (kernel cells.lisp) loads
;;;; it at boot when its directory sits under ~/.nodecode/cells/; the
;;;; gateway calls START-CELL after recovery, which reads the `cron' config
;;;; section, loads the job registry off the store, starts one ticker thread,
;;;; observes the :FRAME point for the turns it fires, puts a primer on every
;;;; session's harness sections so the model knows (cron:add ...) exists, and
;;;; registers /cron.
;;;;
;;;; A sixth axis in the catalogue: channels ADD a surface, the guard
;;;; INTERCEPTS, chrome gives the organism a PERIPHERAL, notify OBSERVES
;;;; egress, websearch is VOCABULARY -- this one gives the organism a CLOCK:
;;;; a prompt that arrives on its own, into a session of its own. hermes-agent's
;;;; cron/ (jobs.json, a 60 s tick, a fresh session per fire, executions and
;;;; notepad ledgers, delivery lanes) reduced to what the kernel does not
;;;; already own: a schedule grammar, one sleeping thread, and a registry row.
;;;; The rest -- at-most-once admission by command id, the transcript as the
;;;; run ledger, the notice board as delivery, the per-session model pin,
;;;; cancel -- is the organism's, reached through its in-process seams.
;;;;
;;;; Every dependency is already in the serving image (cl-ppcre, shasht,
;;;; bordeaux-threads ride with nodecode). The .asd sits INSIDE its folder
;;;; (ADR-0229): install by putting -- or symlinking -- the directory under
;;;; ~/.nodecode/cells/. Presence is enabled; the package is named after the
;;;; system, which is how the loader finds START-CELL.
