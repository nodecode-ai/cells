;;;; What is proved here is the cell's own wiring: the config surface, the
;;;; hooks and /cron, the registry round trip through a real store, that
;;;; a due job fires once through the stubbed ingress with the schedule
;;;; advanced first, that the outcome read off the :frame point lands on the
;;;; record and the board, that SILENT settles quietly, that lateness within
;;;; grace fires and beyond it misses, that a fire runs under its job's
;;;; timeout as its turn's budget, that a duplicate admission is recorded and not retried, that
;;;; a job's own session is refused the scheduling verbs, and that an answer
;;;; is sent to the session that scheduled the job as its next request --
;;;; one user message, the fire line then the answer -- held on the row
;;;; while the ingress refuses it.
