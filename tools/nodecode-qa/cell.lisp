;;;; What leaves this machine, and when, in one place. Sharing is answered
;;;; once — in the setup wizard's panel, or by hand in the config — and never
;;;; asked again: qa.share is `weekly' or `never', and until it is
;;;; either, the cell runs its local half only (the tool, the notes, the
;;;; slash command) and sends nothing. NODECODE_QA=0 in the
;;;; environment turns every send off whatever the config says.
;;;;
;;;; The sender is one worker thread that looks when the period has passed:
;;;; a page folded at that moment, posted once, the cursor moved past it on
;;;; 2xx; a refusal keeps the nonce and looks again in an hour. There is no
;;;; queue, no backoff ladder and no identity that follows the install: the
;;;; nonce is minted per page and the collector forgets it in two weeks.
;;;;
;;;; Config, a top-level key:
;;;;   "qa": {"share": "weekly", "url": "https://preview.nodecode.ai"}
