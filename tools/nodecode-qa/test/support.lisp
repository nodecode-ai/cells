;;;; QA-CELL- name prefix; RUN-QA-TESTS runs exactly that
;;;; slice.
;;;;
;;;; The one seam that reaches outside is NODECODE-QA::*POST*, the
;;;; function the collector is asked with; WITH-STUBBED-COLLECTOR captures
;;;; every post and answers what the test names, so nothing ever dials. The
;;;; sender thread is never started here: WITH-QA stubs START-SENDER out and
;;;; a test runs NODECODE-QA::LOOK by hand, so nothing races the
;;;; assertions; one lifecycle test starts the whole cell.
