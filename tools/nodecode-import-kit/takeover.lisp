;;;; SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
;;;;
;;;; Everything else in this folder reads files. This reads the box: whether
;;;; the harness whose home is being imported is RUNNING, and — because two
;;;; long-pollers on one bot token fight — stopping it so its bots answer
;;;; from here.
;;;;
;;;; It is still not a reader per world. The unit is a manifest field
;;;; (WORLD-TAKEOVER-UNIT); this code takes whatever unit it is handed. Every
;;;; world whose home can carry a bot declares one — Hermes and Openclaw run
;;;; bots of their own — and a world without one is never asked about, so its
;;;; bot would land on beside a gateway still polling it.
;;;;
;;;; Only a request somebody made stops it: `nodecode import WORLD' asks first,
;;;; and /import --yes is the answer given ahead. The setup walk's unasked first
;;;; frame applies with keep_running, so a live gateway is never stopped or
;;;; disabled for it; `nodecode import WORLD' moves its bots later.
;;;;
;;;; The watch is the other half. An import that leaves that gateway
;;;; running — --keep-running, a process outside its unit, a stop that
;;;; failed — lands each bot's section off and puts it on the held record
;;;; (plan.lisp); this watch, in the serving process, looks every few
;;;; seconds, and once the foreign gateway has been gone for two looks
;;;; running — a restart passes through `activating', which the probe counts
;;;; as up — turns the held sections on. One way: the held record is gone,
;;;; and a harness started again later finds its bots taken.
