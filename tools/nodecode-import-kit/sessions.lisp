;;;; sessions.lisp --- foreign conversations as exchanges with their own clock.

;;;; Two shapes hold every transcript the ecosystem writes, and neither is
;;;; a world's invention:
;;;;
;;;;   a JSONL transcript   one line per message — a role, a content, a
;;;;                        timestamp — or one line per session carrying
;;;;                        its messages. Claude Code, Codex, pi and a
;;;;                        Hermes export all write one of the two.
;;;;   a sqlite store       a session table and a message table, joined by
;;;;                        a session column. Hermes, OpenCode and Crush.
;;;;
;;;; So the reader matches COLUMNS and MEMBERS by name, never a schema by
;;;; world: whichever column is called id, which one names the session,
;;;; which one holds the role. A store whose columns say nothing is left
;;;; alone and named in the report.
;;;;
;;;; Each record's messages fold into exchanges: one user side (the user's
;;;; lines up to the answer, joined) and one assistant side (every
;;;; assistant text before the next user line, joined), stamped with the
;;;; answer's time — the shape NLK:RECORD-EXCHANGE-TURN writes as one
;;;; settled turn. Tool rounds are dropped: the store has no way to say a
;;;; tool call happened without having run it. A prompt with no answer is
;;;; dropped and counted.
;;;;
;;;; Conversations are never on a first frame. A real box carries gigabytes
;;;; of them and a provider key is bytes; the plan reads them only when
;;;; they are asked for, newest first, under the folder's session budget.
