;;;; hash tables with string keys, vectors, strings, numbers, T, :FALSE and

;;;; What it takes: comments, bare and quoted keys, dotted keys, tables,
;;;; arrays of tables, basic and literal strings (multi-line included),
;;;; integers in every base, floats, booleans, arrays and inline tables.
;;;; Offset date-times and their kin come through as the strings they are
;;;; written as: nothing here compares them, and a string keeps the
;;;; operator's own text. A document that does not parse is an IMPORT-ERROR
;;;; carrying the line -- there is no per-section recovery here, because
;;;; TOML's own grammar gives a reader no way to resynchronize inside a
;;;; table it has lost its place in.
