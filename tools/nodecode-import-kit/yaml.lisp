;;;; Several agent homes write their settings with a block-style YAML
;;;; dumper -- PyYAML's is the one this reader was written against: `key:
;;;; value' lines, nested blocks two columns in, sequences as `- item'
;;;; lines that sit at their key's own column, `{}' and `[]' for what is
;;;; empty, quotes only where a scalar needs them. This reads that dialect
;;;; and the few flow forms a hand edit adds -- `[a, b]', `{k: v}' -- into
;;;; hash tables with string keys, vectors, strings, numbers, T, :FALSE and
;;;; :NULL: the shape shasht gives JSON, so NLK:JSON-VALUE walks a YAML
;;;; config exactly as it walks config.jsonc, and one shape classifier
;;;; (shape.lisp) reads every format the same way. Anchors, tags, aliases
;;;; and multi-document streams are refused by name rather than guessed at;
;;;; a refusal is an IMPORT-ERROR carrying the line.
