;;;; the index that helped, or whose following did harm; a definition of the
;;;; organism's own that ran and did its job; a verification over a target.
;;;; It is one line of the use ledger the index ranks by (NLK:NOTE-KNOWLEDGE-USE,
;;;; usage.jsonl under the home), naming the definition, the session and the
;;;; turn it is about, and carrying the quote: the ranking is the backward
;;;; pass, so there is no fold of its own to run.
