;;;; Optional quicklisp/ASDF cell, NOT part of the organism core: nothing in
;;;; src/src names this system. The folder loader (kernel cells.lisp) loads
;;;; it at boot when its directory sits under ~/.nodecode/cells/; the
;;;; gateway calls START-CELL after recovery, which reads the `experience'
;;;; config section, observes the :FRAME point for turns ending, fences the
;;;; reflections' tool calls, starts one reflector thread and registers
;;;; /experience.
;;;;
;;;; This cell is the backward pass over what the organism keeps: after an
;;;; operator turn a fork of the session reflects on it - one request behind
;;;; the origin's cached prefix, with tools - recording sightings with
;;;; verbatim quotes in the use ledger the index ranks by (knowledge.lisp),
;;;; keeping memories and skills as definitions, and answering a recap that
;;;; is recorded back into the session as its own note.
;;;;
;;;; Every dependency is already in the serving image. The .asd sits INSIDE
;;;; its folder (ADR-0229): install by putting -- or symlinking -- the
;;;; directory under ~/.nodecode/cells/.
