;;;; Optional quicklisp/ASDF cell, NOT part of the organism core: nothing in
;;;; src/src names this system. The folder loader (kernel cells.lisp) loads
;;;; it at boot when its directory sits under ~/.nodecode/cells/; the
;;;; gateway calls this system's START-CELL after recovery, which compiles
;;;; the `guard` section into waist textrules and hooks them onto the core's
;;;; :TOOL point.
;;;;
;;;; The second catalogued extension example, and deliberately a different axis
;;;; from the rooms (rooms/): a room ADDS a surface, this one INTERCEPTS the
;;;; organism's own behaviour. Both ride the same one-convention seam — and
;;;; this one is the catalogue example of NLE:HOOK, the whole cell being one
;;;; file of rule data around one hook call.
;;;;
;;;; The .asd sits INSIDE its folder (ADR-0229): a cell is a directory
;;;; carrying its .asd, and it is installed by putting — or symlinking — that
;;;; directory under ~/.nodecode/cells/. Presence is enabled; nothing in
;;;; config names it. The `just *` recipes register each cell
;;;; directory with ASDF the same way.
