;;;; Optional quicklisp/ASDF cell, NOT part of the organism core: nothing in
;;;; src/src names this system. The folder loader (kernel cells.lisp) loads
;;;; it at boot when its directory sits under ~/.nodecode/cells/; the
;;;; gateway calls START-CELL after recovery, which starts the bridge the
;;;; extension polls and registers the /chrome slash command.
;;;;
;;;; The third catalogued extension example, on a third axis: channels ADD a
;;;; surface, the guard INTERCEPTS the organism, this one gives the organism a
;;;; PERIPHERAL — the user's real, signed-in Chrome — reached from EVAL
;;;; as plain functions in the CHROME package (mono-tool: no new tool is
;;;; registered). chrome/browser-extension/ is pi-chrome's MV3 extension,
;;;; vendored with the changes its NOTICE lists (MIT); the pi host side is
;;;; re-implemented here, minus its per-session authorization: an HTTP
;;;; long-poll bridge on 127.0.0.1:17318, a <harness> primer block every
;;;; session carries, and the formatters that make a page snapshot fit a tool
;;;; result.
;;;;
;;;; Threat model, verbatim in spirit from pi-chrome's SECURITY.md: the bridge
;;;; is loopback-only and refuses non-extension browser origins (so a web page
;;;; cannot CORS-drive Chrome), but it cannot authenticate local processes —
;;;; the extension carries no token. A hostile local process
;;;; running as you already owns the image; this is a speed bump, as the guard
;;;; cell is (tools/nodecode-guard/cell.lisp). Loading the cell and the
;;;; extension is the grant: every session may drive Chrome.
;;;;
;;;; Every dependency named below is already in the serving image (a transitive
;;;; dependency of nodecode): LOAD-CELLS freezes the loaded systems
;;;; immutable and then loads this one at boot, so a dependency the image lacks
;;;; would have to compile from a vendor/ bundle or fail the folder.
;;;;
;;;; The .asd sits INSIDE its folder (ADR-0229): a cell is a directory
;;;; carrying its .asd, and it is installed by putting — or symlinking — that
;;;; directory under ~/.nodecode/cells/. Presence is enabled; nothing in
;;;; config names it. The `just *` recipes register each cell
;;;; directory with ASDF the same way.
